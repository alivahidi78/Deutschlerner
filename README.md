## Overview
**Deutschlerner** is an interactive language-learning tool that helps users improve their German by reading personalized content. It highlights unfamiliar and learning-phase words in real time, provides instant translations, and adapts to the user’s vocabulary knowledge as they progress. Compatible with .txt and .epub files, Deutschlerner supports Google Translate by default and optionally integrates with dict.cc for offline dictionary use.

## Using an Offline Dictionary (Optional)

Deutschlerner supports the use of an offline dictionary from dict.cc.

To use it:
Visit the [dict.cc dictionary download page](https://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php).
Request and download the German-English translation file (tab-delimited, UTF-8).
In the Deutschlerner UI, go to the settings and import the txt file.
Once imported, translations will be provided using the local dict.cc data by default instead of Google Translate.

Note: You need to agree to dict.cc’s terms of use when downloading their dictionary files.
