## Overview
**Deutschlerner** is an interactive language-learning tool that helps users improve their German by reading personalized content. It highlights unfamiliar and learning-phase words in real time, provides instant translations, and adapts to the userâ€™s vocabulary knowledge as they progress. Compatible with .txt and .epub files, Deutschlerner supports Google Translate by default and optionally integrates with dict.cc for offline dictionary use.
